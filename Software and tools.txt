Our solution has been deployed as a WEB APP

DL TOOLS:
=>Fastai
=>resnet34

PYTHON WEB INTERFACE:
=> Gradio - It is a python module that can be used to create web interfaces

*The best weights from the three models(Covid19 model, Cancer model , TB model) are saved as separate pytorch file
*Then those pythorch files have been loades into separate three fastai resnet34 models
*The test image is given to all the three models and the class can be detemined by using the function 'grad' in the colab notebook 'combined_final_model'
*This can be deployed as a web app using gradio module

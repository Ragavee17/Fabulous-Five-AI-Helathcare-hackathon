COVID19 model:
       =>The model is built using fastai resnet34. 
       =>The model will classify the images into COVID or normal images
CANCER model:
       =>The model is built using fastai resnet34. 
       =>The model will classify the images into adenocarcinoma, larger cell carcinoma,squamous cell carcinoma or normal images
TB model:
       =>The model is built using fastai resnet34.
       =>The model will classify the imag into normal or Tuberculosis image.
Combined final model:
       =>The best weights obtained from the above three models are loaded here as separate three resnet34 models
       =>The test image is given to all the three models
       =>The probability of prediction of all the three models are stored in a list
       =>By accessing the index of the highest probability the class of the image can be predicted
       =>Now the findings is deployed as web app using gradio
